# Website Purpose

# Team/Individual Plans:
- Each pair (Billy/Raq and Sam/Dylan) will switch off between front end and back end every week. This is ideal. Of course there will be weeks where both pairs overlap. Everyone is given assignments on the [scrum board](https://github.com/ChiefGuap/p1-DataPirates/projects/1) every week and the goal is to finish these assignments.
